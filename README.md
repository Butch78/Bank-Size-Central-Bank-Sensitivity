Bank-Size-Central-Bank-Sensitivity
==============================

Exploring the relationship between bank size and sensitivity to central bank policy rate changes.

## Description
Central Banks around the world implement monetary policy in a variety of different ways, but one key transmission mechanism is typically a short-term rate at which commercial banks can borrow from the central bank. This rate, the ‘policy rate’, effectively becomes a floor on other rates, and measuring the sensitivity of other rates, such as the deposit rate, to changes in the policy rate, can give an indication as to how quickly monetary policy is transmitted in each cycle. For this project, the objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of deposit rates on consumer savings accounts to changes in the central banks’ policy rate across different economic cycles. The methodology can then be expanded to multiple countries.
