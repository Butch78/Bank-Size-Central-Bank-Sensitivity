# Deposit rate sensitivity to Central Bank policy target adjustments

Analysis of deposit rate pass through effects from tightening monetary conditions. How the sensitivity to adjustments in central bank policy targets varies across hiking cycles.

## Description

Central Banks around the world implement monetary policy in a variety of different ways, but one key transmission mechanism is typically a short-term rate at which commercial banks can borrow from the central bank. This rate, the â€˜policy rateâ€™, effectively becomes a floor on other rates, and measuring the sensitivity of other rates, such as the deposit rate, to changes in the policy rate, can give an indication as to how quickly monetary policy is transmitted in each cycle. For this project, the objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of deposit rates on consumer savings accounts to changes in the central banksâ€™ policy rate across different economic cycles. The methodology can be expanded to evaluate multiple countries cross sectionally, or to evaluate a single country over several cycles.

The methodology applied in this project is designed to be replicable across different countries and time periods, which allows for its usage in scenarios where central banks provide explicit targets, target ranges, or operate without a clearly defined target. The project can be employed to analyze and compare the sensitivity of deposit rates on consumer savings accounts to changes in central banksâ€™ policy rates across different economic and temporal contexts. This cross-country and cross-temporal applicability assures the project's utility in capturing variations in monetary policy transmission mechanisms globally.

## Data

This project is set up to use monthly policy rates and deposit rates for a particular country. We run this analysis on Switzerland, using data from the Swiss National Bank (SNB). For those looking to replicate this analysis on a different country, if a country doesn't have a specific target, it may be extrapolated from a target range. In the example case, we use the midpoint of a range from the Swiss National Bank from 2000-2019, and then a target from 2019 onwards (they introduced a target at that time).

# Set Up Instructions

### Option 1: Github Codespaces (devcontainer) - Automatic Dev Environment

To get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=master&repo=708763302)

A selection menu will open allowing you to create a Codespace. After create a Codespace it  will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. The [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is fully configured with software needed for this project along with added development vscode extensions such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), Python, and Docker.

It should Automatically build the application and install the ```requirements.txt``` file. if not run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Local Machine

This repository can be [used locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) on a system running Visual Studio Code and Docker, or in a remote cloud based [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) environment as shown in Option 1.

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your local machine, if not follow the instructions here: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

2. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```git clone https://github.com/Butch78/Bank-Size-Central-Bank-Sensitivity.git```

3. After you open the root project in Vscode, the following pop-up should appear. Click "Reopen in Container"

![Alt text](assets/dev_containter_popup.png)

If not click the button in the bottom left corner and then select "Reopen in Container" or type into the command prompt at the top an enter the following command ```>Reopen in container```

This will build the Docker container and should install the requirements.txt file 
Automatically build the application and install the ```requirements.txt``` file along with creating a PostgresDB instance. if not run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Start Application Command

rename the ```.env.example``` in the root directory to ```.env```

Then the following command will load the Data into the PostgresDB and start a FastAPI application on port 8000, You can view the API documentation at <http://localhost:8000/docs>

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Once the application has started The csv files from ```/data/raw```  will automatically be loaded into the PostgresDB instance. 

We can then connect to the Jupyter Notebook: ```notebooks/snb-data-processing.ipynb```  to explore the data with a read only connection to the PostgresDB instance.
